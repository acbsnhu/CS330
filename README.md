How do I approach designing software?
      
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  The new skills this project has helped me to craft would be that it 
  taught me how to render shapes and use those simple shapes to build 
  more complex shapes. It also helped with object positionong and 
  maniplialting the coordinates of objects and my scene in general so that
  all objects are sized correctly.
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I first took the picture I was trying to re create and I broke all objects
  in the scene down into simple shapes that could be used to recreate the 
  objects in the scene. Then I began by making the shapes and sizing them correctly
  in reference to each other. Then I postioned them and added textures to them to
  complete the scene.
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  My tatic of breaking down the scene into managble parts can help in future 
  projects by allowing me to take the big picture of what a client wants whetther
  it be an application or another. By breaking down into smaller and managble parts
  and bringing everything together at the end is a tactic I plan to employ on future projects.

How do I approach developing programs?
        
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  A new strstgy I used was breaking down the coded objects down into parts and then
  combinging and sizing them. This allowed me to better visualise the scene when making
  it instead of trying to do everything in one shot and making mistakes.
  
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration was a huge factor in my development. The first part was just a simple cube, 
  I believe. Then the second was a cube and a cylinder. This helped me gain a lot of 
  knowledge about how the shapes worked, and more importantly, how to manipulate the 
  shapes in the scene. It was a crawl getting from that first cube all the way to 
  the fish tank scene in the final project, but very worthwhile and provided so many 
  learning experiences. 
  
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, 
  which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  My approach changed from doing the milestones just to do them to figuring
  out why things were a certian. This allowed me to have a better grasp on
  the whole thing and have a better quality scene then I would have had if I just 
  went through the motions to ocmplete the work.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
       
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge 
  and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  This was first time using/experimenting with graphics through code and
  was very eye opening for me. The skills I learned in this class will be great 
  improvements on future coursework. This class forced me out of my comfort zone 
  and made me apply myself and perserve even when I got stuck. It taught me to 
  look for the answer and that I didnt need it given to me.
        
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and 
  skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  The skills learned will make me more markable because I will be able to show that 
  I have had expierence with and visualazion and graphics. It will allow me to show
  that I can find an answer to difficult requirments that I may now know the answer
  right away to and that I can do research to find an answer for a client if needed.
